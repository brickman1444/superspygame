*A Superspy Story Game by Zac Gross*

**I Have Just the Thing** is a card-driven storytelling game that emulates spy movies like James Bond or Mission Impossible. The game is intended for 3 or 4 players.

### The Superspy

All players will take turns controlling the same character: Blue Cobra, an international superspy. She's competent, experienced and well connected all around the globe.

## Starting the Game

Players take turns as the Director. The player who most recently watched any sort of spy media (film, television, etc.) is the first Director.

### Create a Supervillain

The first Director draws one card from the Villain deck and draws one card from the Item deck to insert into the villain description. The first player reads the Villain's plot aloud.

## Gameplay

### Turns

During a turn, the Director first draws a Scene Card and reads it aloud. For the first scene, read the prompt on the Villain Card instead of drawing a Scene Card. The player to the left of the Director draws three Item cards, chooses one and discards the others. At the same time, the player to the right of the Director draws three Function cards, chooses one and discards the others. The Director looks at these cards and prepares to tell the scene. They can choose to reveal the cards at any point during their turn.

The Function Card and the Item Card for the round defines a spy gadget in the form of: “An [Item Card] that [Function Card]” such as “A *golf club* that *poisons sharks*.” The player narrates a scene following the prompt from the Scene Card and involving Blue Cobra getting into a type of trouble where her gadget is the perfect thing to get her out of trouble.

> For example, with the golf club that poisons sharks, if the Director had drawn the Scene Card for "An ally is killed," they would narrate a scene where Blue Cobra plays golf with the villain to gain information on them. The villain figures out the ploy and throws Blue Cobra and her caddy into a pool of sharks. The caddy doesn't survive, but luckily Blue Cobra brought her golf club that poisons sharks and is able to save herself.

After their turn, the Director places the Function and Item cards together in front of them. The gadget may be used later in the Conclusion. The Director discards the Scene Card. The player to their left becomes the new Director.

### Telling a Scene

The scene should continue the story established by the other players, but a scene can jump around in time. A Director can pick up the action immediately after the last scene, jump forward to the next day or go into a flashback. As long as the other players are comfortable, a Director can establish whatever they want in their scene, but the focus of the scene should be on how the gadget helps Blue Cobra get out of trouble. Directors should adapt to their play group, but keeping scenes between one and five minutes long is a good guideline. 

### The Conclusion

After each player has had a turn, any player can choose to start the Conclusion on their turn by saying, "Let's start the conclusion." The Conclusion is one scene that each player participates in. Instead of drawing a Scene Card, the scene prompt is "Blue Cobra foils the Villain's plan". Starting with the player who began the Conclusion, each player takes a turn narrating a small bit into the scene. They choose one of the gadgets previously created by the player on their right to incorporate into the scene.

After each player has participated in the Conclusion, the player who began the conclusion can optionally narrate an epilogue scene to finish up any remaining story threads.
