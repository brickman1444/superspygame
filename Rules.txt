I Have Just the Thing

By Zac Gross

	I Have Just the Thing is a storytelling game about a superspy which is meant to emulate spy movies like James Bond. The game is intended for 2 to 8 players.

Setup

	First, as a group, come up with a superspy character. They should have a nationality, and a physical description. It often helps to pick an actor or actress to cast as the superspy. The superspy cannot be a white man and the starting location must be outside the United States and the United Kingdom. Pick a code name by taking one color and one animal:

Black		Tiger
White		Fox
Green		Snake
Red		Eagle
Blue		Trout
Brown		Stag
Silver		Bat

	Next, come up with a supervillain name, such as Dr. Villanous, Colonel Pain or Lady Moneybags.

	Next, create the plot deck. Without looking at the text of the cards, draw the number of scene cards for the number of players you have:

# players	# scene cards
2		3
3		3
4		5
5		7
6		9
7		4
8		5

	Create the plot deck by placing the Final Conflict card face down to make the bottom. Then place a scene card. Then place the Plot Reveal card. Then place the rest of the scene cards. Top it off with the Briefing Card and finally the Last Mission Card.

Gameplay

	The game is played in turns. The player who most recently saw a superspy movie goes first. Each player will take a turn narrating a scene and then control will pass to the player on their left. 

Turns
	On a turn, the controlling player draws an Item Card and a Function Card. This defines a cool gadget in the form of: “It’s a [Item Card] that [Function Card]” such as “It’s a form fitting tuxedo that poisons sharks.” The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene with the superspy in it continuing the story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget (the cards they drew) is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble. A scene should take about 1-2 minutes.
	For example, with the form fitting tuxedo that poisons sharks, the player would narrate a scene where the superspy goes to a fancy party to gather information. Then the villain floods the room and releases sharks. The superspy saves the partiers by jumping into the mouths of sharks and poisoning them. 
Currency
Each player starts with a pool of seven tokens. Tokens can be used in the following ways:
Tipping another player after a particularly good scene
Giving away one token to redraw a card
Giving away one token to add or change something in another player’s scene. This can be refused by giving back two tokens to the player who wanted influence.

The player who ends with the most tokens is the “winner” but it’s more about telling a good story and having fun.
