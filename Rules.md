# I Have Just the Thing

*By Zac Gross*

**I Have Just the Thing** is a storytelling game about a superspy which is meant to emulate spy movies like James Bond. The game is intended for 2 to 8 players.

## Setup

### Create a Superspy

As a group you will come up with your protagonist, the superspy.

1. First, pick a look for your superspy by picking a Face Card. Put away the rest of the Face Cards.

1. Then pick one Mental Attribute Card and one Physical Attribute Card to describe the most defining parts of the superspy. Put those cards in the center of the playing surface and put away the rest the unused cards.

1. Pick a codename and write it down on a piece of paper in the center of your playing surface. If you can't think of one, choose a color and an animal like Red Tiger or Blue Eagle.

	- Colors: Black, White, Green, Red, Blue
	- Animals: Tiger, Fox, Snake, Eagle, Elephant

### Create a Supervillain

As a group you will come up with your antagonist, the supervillain.

1. First, pick one Motivation Card to describe the motivation behind the supervillain's evil plot. Put the card in the center and put away the rest.

1. Next, come up with a supervillain name, such as Dr. Villanous, Colonel Pain or Lady Moneybags. Write it down on a piece of paper and put it in the center with their Motivation Card.


### Plot Cards

Next, lay out the plot cards on your playing surface by following the column in the diagram below for the number of players you have. Each card should be placed face down and arranged in a line that looks like the diagram. Randomly select Scene Cards and don't look at the front of them. Put away the unused Scene Cards.

### Influence Tokens

Give everyone one Influence Token.

### Starting Location

Right before beginning the first turn, pick a starting location which is where the  story will start and where superspy is from. The starting location must be a real place outside the United States and the United Kingdom. Some fun starting locations are the the Pyramids, Egypt; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Seoul, Korea; and Budapest, Hungary.

## Gameplay

The game is played in rounds and turns. A round consists of every player having a turn. During a turn, a player narrates a scene and once they are done, control will pass to the player on their left. The player who most recently saw a spy movie gets the first turn. Influence Tokens can be spent at any point. 

### Rounds

At the beginning of each round, each player draws an Item Card and places that card in front of them face up so the other players can see what it says.

### Turns
On a turn, the controlling player draws a Function Card and a Scene Card. The Function Card and their Item Card for the round defines a cool gadget in the form of: “It’s a ________ that _________” such as “It’s a golf club that poisons sharks.” The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene following the prompt from the Scene Card continuing the established story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget (the cards they drew) is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble. A scene should take about 1-5 minutes.

For example, with the golf club that poisons sharks, if the player had drawn the Scene Card for "A fancy party or high stakes gambling," the player would narrate a scene where the superspy gambles on a round of golf with the villain. After losing, the villain floods the course and releases sharks. The superspy saves the other golfers by tapping each shark with the club and poisoning them.

After their turn, the player discards their Function, Item and Scene Cards.
 
### Influence Tokens

Each player starts with a one Influence Token. Influence Tokens can be spent for the following effects:

- Redraw a Item or Function card. You can draw two more cards and then choose from all three which one you want to keep.
- Change a detail in someone else's scene. For example you could add a character to a scene, add an attribute to a character, add some dialogue to a character or change the environment. This can be to make the scene funnier, to help out a struggling player or to give a challenge to an experienced player.
