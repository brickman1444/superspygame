# I Have Just the Thing

*A Superspy Story Game by Zac Gross*

You will all be playing the same character: Blue Cobra, a competent international superspy.

## Starting the Game

The player who most recently saw a spy movie gets the first turn.

### Create a Supervillain

The first player draws one card from the Villain deck and draws one card from the Item deck to insert into the villain description. The first player reads the Villain's plot aloud.

### Cards

Each player starts with a hand of four Function cards.

## Gameplay

The game is played in turns. During a turn, a player narrates a scene and once they are done, control will pass to the player on their left. 

### Turns
On a turn, a player narrates a scene. They draw the Scene card for this turn and read it aloud. For the first scene, read the prompt on the Villain card instead. The player to their left draws three Item cards, chooses one to play face up and discards the others. The controlling player chooses a Function Card from their hand to play.

The played Function Card and the played Item Card for the round defines a cool gadget in the form of: “A ________ that _________” such as “A *golf club* that *poisons sharks*.” The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene following the prompt from the Scene Card continuing the established story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble.

> For example, with the golf club that poisons sharks, if the player had drawn the Scene Card for "An ally is killed," the player would narrate a scene where the superspy plays golf with the villain to gain information on them. The villain figures out the ploy, throws the superspy and their caddy into a pool of sharks. The caddy doesn't survive, but the luckily the superspy brought their golf club that poison sharks and is able to take out the sharks and get away.

After their turn, the player places the played Function and Item cards together in front of them.

### Telling a Scene

The scene should continue the story established by the other players, but a scene can jump around in time. Players can pick up the action immediately after the last scene, jump forward to the next day or go into a flashback. As long as the other players are comfortable, you can establish whatever you want in your scene, but your scene should be focused on how the gadget helps Blue Cobra get out of trouble. Players should adapt to their play group, but keeping scenes under five minutes long is a good guideline. 

### The Conclusion

After each player has had a turn, any player can choose to start the Conclusion on their turn by saying, "Let's start the conclusion." The Conclusion is one Scene that each player participates in. The Scene prompt is "The Superspy defeats the Villain". Starting with the player who began the Conclusion, each player takes a turn narrating a small bit into the scene. They choose one of the gadgets previously created by the player on their right to incorporate into the scene.

After each player has participated in the Conclusion, the player who began the conclusion can optionally narrate an epilogue scene to finish up any remaining story threads. 

## Optional Rules

Try playing with anywhere between 2 and 10 players
