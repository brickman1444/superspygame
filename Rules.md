# I Have Just the Thing

*By Zac Gross*

**I Have Just the Thing** is a storytelling game about a superspy which is meant to emulate spy movies like James Bond. The game is intended for 2 to 8 players.

## Setup

### The Superspy

You will all be playing the same character: Blue Tiger, a competent international superspy.

### Create a Supervillain

Draw one card from the Villain deck and draw one card from the Item deck to insert into the villain description. 

## Gameplay

The game is played in turns. During a turn, a player narrates a scene and once they are done, control will pass to the player on their left. The player who most recently saw a spy movie gets the first turn.

If you have four or fewer players, each player will get two turns. If you have more than four players, each player will get one turn. After each player has had enough turns, vote on one player to get a final turn and finish the story. 

### Turns
On a turn, the controlling player draws an Item Card, a Function Card and a Scene Card. The Item and Scene cards are face up, and the Function card is face down with only the controlling player knowing what it is.

The Function Card and the Item Card for the round defines a cool gadget in the form of: “A ________ that _________” such as “It’s a golf club that poisons sharks.” The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene following the prompt from the Scene Card continuing the established story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget (the cards they drew) is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble. A scene should take about 1-5 minutes.

For example, with the golf club that poisons sharks, if the player had drawn the Scene Card for "An ally is killed," the player would narrate a scene where the superspy plays golf with the villain to gain information on them. The villain figures out the ploy, throws the superspy and their caddy into a pool of sharks. The caddy doesn't survive, but the superspy is able to get away by hitting each shark with the club and poisoning them.

Once the function is narrated into the story, the player reveals the Function Card.

After their turn, the player discards their Function, Item and Scene Cards.
