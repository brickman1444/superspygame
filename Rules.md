# I Have Just the Thing

*By Zac Gross*

**I Have Just the Thing** is a storytelling game about a superspy which is meant to emulate spy movies like James Bond. The game is intended for 2 to 8 players.

## Setup

### The Superspy

You will all be playing the same character: Blue Tiger, a competent international superspy.

### Create a Supervillain

Draw one card from the Villain deck and draw one card from the Item deck to insert into the villain description. 

### Cards

Each player starts with a hand of four Function cards. Lay out all the Scene cards for the game face down in a row in a central place.

## Gameplay

The game is played in turns. During a turn, a player narrates a scene and once they are done, control will pass to the player on their left. The player who most recently saw a spy movie gets the first turn.

If you have four or fewer players, each player will get two turns. If you have more than four players, each player will get one turn. After each player has had enough turns, vote on one player to get a final turn and finish the story. 

### Turns
On a turn, one player is the controlling player who tells the scene. They flip over the Scene card for this scene and read it aloud. The player to their left draws three Item cards and chooses one to play face up. That is the Item for the scene and the other Item cards are discarded. The controlling player chooses a Function Card from their hand to play. They can keep the choosen Function secret until it is revealed in the scene.

The Function Card and the Item Card for the round defines a cool gadget in the form of: “A ________ that _________” such as “It’s a golf club that poisons sharks.” The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene following the prompt from the Scene Card continuing the established story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget (the cards they drew) is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble. A scene should take about 1-5 minutes.

For example, with the golf club that poisons sharks, if the player had drawn the Scene Card for "An ally is killed," the player would narrate a scene where the superspy plays golf with the villain to gain information on them. The villain figures out the ploy, throws the superspy and their caddy into a pool of sharks. The caddy doesn't survive, but the superspy is able to get away by hitting each shark with the club and poisoning them.

Once the function is narrated into the story, the player reveals the Function Card.

After their turn, the player places the played Function and Item cards next to the Scene card.

### The End

After each player has had one turn, any player can choose to end the game on their turn. They do not get a new Item card and they don't play a new Function card. Their Scene prompt is "The superspy defeats the villain". They must use at least three of the gadgets that have already been played to fulfill their scene.
