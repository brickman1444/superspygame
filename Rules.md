# I Have Just the Thing

*By Zac Gross*

**I Have Just the Thing** is a storytelling game about a superspy which is meant to emulate spy movies like James Bond. The game is intended for 2 to 8 players.

## Setup

### Characters

As a group you will come up with your main character, the superspy, and the basics of the supervillain. The superspy cannot be a white man, but the supervillain can be.

First, pick a starting location which is where the superspy is from. The starting location must be a real place outside the United States and the United Kingdom. Some fun starting locations are the the Pyramids, Egypt; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Seoul, Korea; and Budapest, Hungary. 

Pick a codename. If you can't think of one, choose a color and an animal:

| Color | Animal |
| --- | --- |
|Black|Tiger|
|White|Fox|
|Green|Snake|
|Red|Eagle|
|Blue|Elephant|

Then pick one mental descriptor from the following list:

Clumsy, Sauve, Smart, Comedic, Impulsive, Doubtful, Romantic, Silent, Violent, Pristine, Refined, Skittish

And pick one physical descriptor from the following list:

Old, Young, Saggy, Greasy, Hot, Jovial, Stone-faced, Buff, Quick, Lanky, Plump

Next, come up with a supervillain name, such as Dr. Villanous, Colonel Pain or Lady Moneybags.


### Plot Cards

Next, lay out the plot cards on your playing surface by following the column in the diagram below for the number of players you have. Each card should be placed face down and arranged in a line that looks like the diagram. Randomly select Scene Cards and don't look at the front of them.

Finally, give everyone one Influence Token.

## Gameplay

The game is played in rounds and turns. A round consists of every player having a turn. During a turn, a player narrates a scene and once they are done, control will pass to the player on their left. The player who most recently saw a spy movie gets the first turn. Influence Tokens can be spent at any point. 

### Rounds

At the beginning of each round, each player draws an Item Card and places that card in front of them face up so the other players can see what it says.

### Turns
On a turn, the controlling player draws a Function Card and a Scene Card. The Function Card and their Item Card for the round defines a cool gadget in the form of: “It’s a ________ that _________” such as “It’s a golf club that poisons sharks.” The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene following the prompt from the Scene Card continuing the established story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget (the cards they drew) is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble. A scene should take about 1-5 minutes.

For example, with the golf club that poisons sharks, if the player had drawn the Scene Card for "A fancy party or high stakes gambling," the player would narrate a scene where the superspy gambles on a round of golf with the villain. After losing, the villain floods the course and releases sharks. The superspy saves the other golfers by tapping each shark with the club and poisoning them.

After their turn, the player discards their Function, Item and Scene Cards.
 
### Influence Tokens

Each player starts with a one Influence Token. Influence Tokens can be spent for the following effects:

- Redraw a Item or Function card. You can draw two more cards and then choose from all three which one you want to keep.
- Change a detail in someone else's scene. For example you could add a character to a scene, add an attribute to a character, add some dialogue to a character or change the environment. This can be to make the scene funnier, to help out a struggling player or to give a challenge to an experienced player.
