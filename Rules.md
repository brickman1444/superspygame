# I Have Just the Thing

*By Zac Gross*

**I Have Just the Thing** is a storytelling game about a superspy which is meant to emulate spy movies like James Bond. The game is intended for 2 to 8 players.

## Setup

### The Superspy

You will all be playing Blue Tiger, a competent international superspy.

As a group you will come up with your protagonist, the superspy.

### Create a Supervillain

Draw one card from the Villain deck and draw one card from the item deck to insert into the villain description. 

## Gameplay

The game is played in turns. During a turn, a player narrates a scene and once they are done, control will pass to the player on their left. The player who most recently saw a spy movie gets the first turn.

If you have four or fewer players, each player will get two turns. If you have more than four players, each player will get one turn. After each player has had enough turns, vote on one player to get a final turn and finish the story. 

### Turns
On a turn, the controlling player draws an Item, Function Card and a Scene Card. The Item and Scene cards are face up, and the Item card is face down with only the controlling player know what it is.

The Function Card and their Item Card for the round defines a cool gadget in the form of: “It’s a ________ that _________” such as “It’s a golf club that poisons sharks.” The player does not reveal the cards to the other players. The player narrates a scene following the prompt from the Scene Card continuing the established story. The scene must involve the superspy getting into a type of trouble or conflict where their gadget (the cards they drew) is the perfect thing to get them out of trouble. A scene should take about 1-5 minutes.

For example, with the golf club that poisons sharks, if the player had drawn the Scene Card for "A fancy party or high stakes gambling," the player would narrate a scene where the superspy gambles on a round of golf with the villain. After losing, the villain floods the course and releases sharks. The superspy saves the other golfers by tapping each shark with the club and poisoning them.

After their turn, the player discards their Function, Item and Scene Cards.
